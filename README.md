## "32 Deck Challenge" Visualizer
This application creates a diagram to visualize progress for the "32 Deck Challenge" some Magic: the
Gathering Commander players participate in. The challenge is to build a deck for each color
combination: 5 mono-color decks, 10 two-color decks 9one for each pair of the 5 colors), 10
three-color decks (the five Shards of Alara "shards" and the five Khans of Tarkir "wedges"), 5
four-color decks, a five-color deck, and a colorless deck.

The diagram allows the user to select color combinations from a compact layout, choose a Commander
which fits that color combination, and display that Commander's image in the appropriate region of
the diagram. Additional features, such as linking to deckbuilding websites to include deck lists,
and sharing the user's diagram are also planned. However, the aim of this project is to keep the
visualization lightweight.

### Building the application
After cloning the repository, install all dependencies with `npm install`. You will then be able to
compile the TypeScript into JavaScript and compile the SASS into CSS using `npm run build`.
Alternatively, if you intend to develop for the project, you can run `npm run watch` to rebuild when
changes are made.

### Running the application
Ultimately, this application will be hosted on its own website, accessible to all. However, if
you're developing for the project and want to run the application locally, you can use `node .`
while the project root is your current working directory. (Or from another directory, run `node` on
the project root.) The localhost server will run on port 3004.
